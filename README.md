# seceng-atlas

The Security Engineering Atlas is a collection of mappings, frameworks, and observables that are present across common operating systems, infrastructure providers, and cloud providers. The goal of this project is to provide a common language for security engineers to communicate about the security of their systems, mapping to common frameworks and providing reusability across multiple systems.
