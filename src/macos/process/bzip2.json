    "description": "bzip2 is a freely available, patent-free, high-quality data compressor. It typically compresses files to within 10% to 15% of the best available techniques, while being around twice as fast at compression and six times faster at decompression. bzip2 compresses files using the Burrows-Wheeler block-sorting text compression algorithm, and Huffman coding. Compression is generally considerably better than that achieved by more conventional LZ77/LZ78-based compressors, and approaches the performance of the PPM family of statistical compressors.",
