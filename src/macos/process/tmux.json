    "description": "Tmux is a terminal multiplexer that allows users to access multiple separate terminal sessions inside a single terminal window or remote terminal session. It allows control over attached sessions, making it possible to detach and reattach sessions from a terminal. It is used for a resilient and flexible terminal environment, and it aids in the management of multiple command line programs from a single interface without using additional graphical interfaces.",
