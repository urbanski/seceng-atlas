    "description": "The fg command is used to put a suspended or background job in the foreground of the current shell session. It resumes a suspended job by default, but can also reintroduce stopped or background tasks, allowing them to continue running interactively. This is essential for managing multitasking in a terminal environment. By using fg, a user can directly interface with the job as if it had been started in the foreground originally.",
