    "description": "Socat is a command line based utility that establishes two bidirectional byte streams and transfers data between them. Because the streams can be constructed from a large set of different data sinks and sources (like files, pipes, devices, or sockets), socat can be used for a vast array of tasks in networking as well as in interprocess communication. It supports data transfer between a variety of address types, encryption, and direct connections, and can be used for debugging, testing, or configuring applications and networks.",
