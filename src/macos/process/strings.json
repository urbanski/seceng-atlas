    "description": "Strings is a command-line tool used in Unix and Unix-like operating systems. It is designed to display printable sequences of characters from binary files. This tool is particularly useful for analyzing binary executables to find human-readable text, which can include error messages, debug messages, or other interesting content. In a cybersecurity context, it can be used to analyze malicious files to glean insight into their functionalities without executing them, thus providing a safer method of preliminary investigation.",
