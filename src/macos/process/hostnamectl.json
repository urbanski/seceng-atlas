    "description": "Hostnamectl is a utility in Linux-based systems used to query and change the system hostname and related settings. It belongs to the systemd suite, providing an easy command-line interface to configure the hostname. The command can show detailed hostname information and set various host-related settings, such as the static hostname, pretty hostname, and icon name. This command simplifies the mechanism of hostname management which was traditionally handled by manually editing system files like '/etc/hostname'.",
