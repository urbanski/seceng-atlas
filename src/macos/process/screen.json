    "description": "GNU Screen is a terminal multiplexer that allows users to manage multiple terminal sessions from a single window. It is particularly useful in remote terminal sessions and for detaching and resuming sessions without losing current processes. Screen can help users multitask in the command-line environment, manage several programs in one terminal, detach and reattach sessions without interrupting running programs, and provides capabilities for session sharing.",
