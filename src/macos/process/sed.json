    "description": "sed, short for stream editor, is an essential tool designed for basic text transformation on an input stream or in a file. It allows users to quickly perform simple text replacement to complex transformation. sed is non-interactive, making it extremely suitable for automatic editing tasks. It primarily operates by constructing a sequence of editing commands to apply, which is powerful for scripting or in UNIX pipelines. This tool is omnipresent in Unix-like operating systems, useful for script writing and data preprocessing.",
