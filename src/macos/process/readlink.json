    "description": "Readlink is a command-line utility for resolving symbolic links to their original file paths. It prints the value of a symbolic link or canonical file name. This tool is typically used to find the actual path that a symbolic link points to on a filesystem. It helps in scripting and file management tasks by returning the final absolute pathname when given a relative one. Readlink is crucial in environments where multiple symbolic links are extensively used for organizing libraries or configurations.",
