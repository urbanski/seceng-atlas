    "description": "Zsh is a powerful command line interpreter for UNIX systems. It is designed for interactive use, although it is also a powerful scripting language. Many of the useful features of bash, ksh, and tcsh were incorporated into zsh; many original features were added. The z-shell is a command interpreter usable as an interactive login shell and as a shell script command processor. Zsh is more scriptable and extensible than bash. Zsh is noted for its robust command-line completion system.",
