    "description": "Touch is a standard Unix command-line utility that updates the access and modification times of files to the current time. If a file does not exist, it will be created empty unless it is in a directory that does not exist or in a read-only file system. Additionally, it does not modify the file contents. This command is frequently used in scripting and other automation processes to manage file timestamps.",
