    "description": "The 'env' executable is used to run a program in a modified environment. It can be used to either list the current environment variables when run without arguments or set environment variables and run a command. This can be a useful tool for testing software under different configurations. Furthermore, 'env' can be utilized in scripts to ensure that the correct environment is used without regard to the current shell's environment settings. Hackers might use 'env' to bypass restricted environments by setting or unsetting environment variables.",
