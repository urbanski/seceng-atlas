    "description": "SSH Agent is a program that holds private keys used for public key authentication (RSA, DSA, ECDSA, ED25519). The agent provides a way to use the keys stored within it to perform authentication requests without having to expose those keys to client programs. It acts as a helper to SSH clients by managing keys in a secure way and providing them to the client programs only when required for authentication purposes. This is particularly useful for automated, password-less logins and single sign-on operations across different systems.",
