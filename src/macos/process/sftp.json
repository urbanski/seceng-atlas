It is often used to securely upload or download files between the local system and a remote server. The secure nature of SFTP allows it to provide a safer way to transfer files as compared to traditional FTP, by leveraging the underlying SSH protocols. This application is commonly used in automated scripts and batch jobs for maintaining file synchronization across different servers securely. It supports operations like file upload, file download, and file manipulation on the remote server.",
