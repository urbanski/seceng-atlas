    "description": "sed, which stands for stream editor, is a Unix utility that parses and transforms text, using a simple and compact programming language. It reads text input, either from stdin or from a file, and applies operations that have been specified in a script to the text. Operations include pattern matching, substitution, and insertion. sed is commonly used for extracting portions of text from a file based on patterns, modifying files in-place, and can be very useful in scripts due to its editing capabilities without opening an editor interface.",
