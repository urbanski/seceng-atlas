    "description": "GNU Bash is the command language interpreter for the GNU operating system. It is a widely installed Unix shell that is used as the default shell on most Linux distributions. Bash is an sh-compatible shell that incorporates useful features from the Korn shell (ksh) and the C shell (csh). It is intended to be a conformant implementation of the IEEE POSIX Shell and Tools specification. Bash can read and execute commands from a file, called a script. The shell offers programming features to make it easy to write structured programs directly from the command line. It also supports interactive use.",
