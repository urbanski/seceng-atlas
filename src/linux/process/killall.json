    "description": "Killall is a command-line utility available on Linux systems that enables users to terminate all processes running a specified program. By default, it sends a SIGTERM signal to all processes that are named as the command argument. This utility is useful for system administrators when they need to quickly stop all instances of a process. It can also send any signal to all processes of a user, useful during system shutdowns or restarts. As a potent tool, it requires careful handling to avoid inadvertently stopping critical system processes.",
