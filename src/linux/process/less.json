    "description": "Less is a command-line utility in Unix and Unix-like operating systems that displays the contents of a file or a command output, one page at a time. It is similar to more, but has the extended capability of allowing both forward and backward navigation through the file as well as other features. Less does not have to read the entire input file before starting, so with large input files, it starts up faster than text editors like vi. Less uses termcap (or terminfo on some systems), so it can run on a variety of terminals. There is no limit to the size of an input file that less can handle.",
