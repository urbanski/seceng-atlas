    "description": "GNU Screen is a terminal multiplexer that allows for multiple separate terminal sessions to be accessed on a single screen. It's useful for detaching and reattaching sessions, managing multiple command-line interfaces concurrently, and keeping sessions running after disconnection. Screen can be particularly useful when managing servers remotely, allowing long-running processes to continue even when a user logs out.",
