    "description": "insmod is a simple program used to insert a module into the Linux kernel. This utility is essential for system administrators when adding new functionality to the running kernel without requiring a reboot. Common uses include loading device drivers and kernel extensions. Due to its nature, insmod can be misused if unauthorized access is gained, as it allows direct interaction with the kernel.",
