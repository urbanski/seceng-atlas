    "description": "Netcat is a versatile networking tool that can read from and write to network connections using TCP or UDP. It is often referred to as a 'Swiss-army knife' for TCP/IP. Its functionality is helpful for debugging and network exploration. Netcat can also function as a backdoor, allowing stealthy access to compromised systems, thus it is critical in pen-testing and network security. Capable of scriptable port scans, banner grabbing, and more, Netcat can create almost any kind of connection and has extensive utility in network exploitation.",
