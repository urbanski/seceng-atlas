    "description": "SFTP, or Secure File Transfer Protocol, is used for secure file transfer capabilities over the SSH protocol. It provides all the features of SCP and includes features like resuming interrupted transfers, directory listings, and remote file removal. Unlike SCP, which supports only file transfers, SFTP allows for a range of operations on remote files. It encrypts both commands and data, providing effective protection against common network security risks. SFTP is used as a command-line interface for transferring files securely between computers on a network.",
