    "description": "The 'at' utility in Linux is used for scheduling commands to be executed once at a particular time in the future. Users can submit jobs which 'at' will execute at specified times, provided the system is running. It reads commands from standard input or a specified file. This utility is commonly used for one-time tasks that need to run at a specific time, maintaining flexibility in automated job scheduling.",
