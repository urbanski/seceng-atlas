    "description": "ssh-add is a command used to add SSH private keys into the SSH authentication agent for implementing single sign-on with SSH. The program adds private key identities to the authentication agent, enabling the user to use the key without having to enter a passphrase with each use. This simplifies the process of logging into a remote host without compromising the security of the passphrase. It typically works with ssh-agent to load keys into the environment. ssh-add also provides the capability to list and delete keys currently added to the SSH agent.",
