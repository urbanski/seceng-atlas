    "description": "ln is a standard Unix command used to create links between files. By default, it creates hard links; with the -s option, it creates symbolic (soft) links. Symbolic links can reference any file or directory by pathname, serving as a shortcut or a simple method to access related files and directories. It is often used to make system files or programs accessible from different locations without duplicating data.",
