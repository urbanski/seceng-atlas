    "description": "Tshark is the command-line version of Wireshark, a network protocol analyzer. It allows users to capture and interactively browse the traffic running on a computer network. Tshark is used for network troubleshooting, analysis, software and communications protocol development, and education. It provides all of the features of Wireshark but is controlled via a command-line interface, and holds the advantage of having a lower system profile than its GUI counterpart.",
