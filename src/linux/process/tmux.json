    "description": "tmux is a terminal multiplexer that allows users to switch easily between several programs in one terminal, detach them, and reattach them to a different terminal. This tool allows multiple terminal sessions to be accessed simultaneously and independently in a single window. It is also useful for sharing sessions and provides more stable and feature-filled terminal management than screen. Tmux sessions survive network disconnections and can be attached to different terminals, making it valuable for remote work.",
