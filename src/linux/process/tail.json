    "description": "The tail command is used in Linux for outputting the last part of files. It can display the last lines of a file directly to the terminal or save them to a new file. By default, it shows the last 10 lines of the specified files. Tail is particularly useful for viewing the end of long files, monitoring log files in real-time, or providing updates when a file is appended. This command is commonly used for troubleshooting and monitoring system operations within a Linux environment.",
