    "description": "Unset is typically used to unset a shell variable in Linux. It effectively removes the variable from the environment, making it unavailable for subsequent processes. This utility is part of the broader suite of shell built-in commands that interact with environment variables. It is primarily used in scripting to make sure that no unintended or residual variables carry forward, potentially affecting script execution or security.",
