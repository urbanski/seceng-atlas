    "description": "The cut command in Linux is used to remove sections from each line of files. It can be used to cut parts of a line by byte position, character, and field. This utility reads input from standard input or from a list of files and writes to standard output. It's useful for scripting and data preprocessing for more complex commands or scripts. For example, it can extract columns of text from a CSV file or reformat output of another command. This makes it an indispensable tool in text processing tasks common in system administration and scripting environments.",
