    "description": "nohup is a POSIX command to ignore the HUP (hangup) signal. The HUP signal is sent to a process when its controlling terminal is closed. It is used to run commands in the background safely even after logging out of a shell session. The command allows the ongoing execution of the program with output redirected to a file, typically nohup.out, if not specified otherwise. This is particularly useful for running processes via SSH that should not terminate when the SSH session ends.",
