    "description": "Disown is a shell built-in command that removes jobs from the job table of the current shell session, which results in the shell not sending a SIGHUP to disowned jobs when the shell session is terminated. This command is primarily used to detach a running process from the current shell session, allowing it to continue running in the background even after the user logs out. This can be particularly useful for long-running processes that do not require user interaction.",
